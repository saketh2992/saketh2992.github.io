        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a seasoned professional with extensive expertise in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). My academic journey includes an M.Tech followed by a Ph.D. in CFD, a testament to my deep-rooted passion for the domain. The world of simulations and computational studies has always fascinated me, and my work in this field has been recognized through various publications, with three of them bearing my name as the first author.

            Parallel to my research endeavors, I've also immersed myself in the realm of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML). Over the past 18 months, I've had the privilege to mentor and instruct postgraduate students and working professionals, elucidating complex AI/ML concepts with clarity and depth. Teaching is not just a profession for me, but a medium to share knowledge, inspire innovation, and shape the next generation of tech enthusiasts.

            With a blend of academic and practical experience, I've always been keen on harnessing the power of technology to solve real-world challenges. I'm constantly seeking opportunities to collaborate, innovate, and elevate the standards of research and education in both CFD and AI/ML.
